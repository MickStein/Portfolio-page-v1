# Portfolio-page-v1
 
Introduction:

This page has been made for practicing developing front-end skills in HTML, CSS & JavaScript, featuring the Bootstrap 4 framework and SASS. Bootstrap has been partially implemented as general practice and SASS has been added but is yet to be implemented while refactoring. It does/will feature other projects I have done in my spare time.

Comments & pull requests:
Feel free to comment, refactor or copy the code. I encourage contributions or using it to build anything yourself. 

Notes:
The progress bars are not a feature I am particularly fond of with portfolio sites, however I thoroughly enjoy designing them which is why I have some! Although some parts such as the portfolio section has been from templates from Bootstrap's website, the progress bars are dreated by me. Again please feel free to use it as a template if you want to use them!
